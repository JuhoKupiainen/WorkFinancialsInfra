# #notfree = this information is publicly available, but its creators expect to be paid an amount equal to its usefulness, at some point.

This app allows you to analyse what work you should be doing, record evidence of you doing it, and present the evidence.

money = evidence of useful work

Note that equality is commutative.

Things that are about producing new useful information, are things like making movies, developing new medications, answering questions on question and answer sites. All of these things take hard work. The output of this work, is information that is highly valuable to a lot of people. 
 
How can one sell this information? If you set a fixed price for a given block of information, for example you give a fixed price for an E-book, then there are always some people who don’t buy it because it’s too expensive. Isn’t that how it’s supposed to be? If you don’t want to pay the full price, then you shouldn’t get the product. Well, if you were selling rice, or oil, that would make sense, but with information, it doesn’t make sense because the information already exists and you can copy information as much as you want, that doesn’t cost anything. Reducing the price gains more customers, but since the price is lower for everyone, including the already existing customers, it’s not profitable to do so. 
 
One could give a price that depends on the person, if someone seems like they really want the E-book for example, we give them a higher price, and make a legal contract prohibiting them from redistributing the book. The problem with this is that it’s difficult to guess how much someone would be willing to pay. What if someone wants to browse through a book. A split second decision needs to be made, about how useful this browsing experience is. And what if someone writes a book that has the same content, but written in different words, and sells their book for a much lower price?
 
The best way, the only way really, is to collect taxes from people and vote for how these taxes are spent on information producing projects. There are two ways to do this.
 
The first way is to pay pay people as they are doing the work, based on how useful we think the outcome of the work will be.
 
The second way is to pay people when they’ve done the work and we can analyze how useful the work was.
 
In the first way people get the money right away, whereas in the second way people have to get a loan and wait for the money.
 
In the first way it can be often difficult for outsiders to understand what the outcome of some work will be, before it’s ready, and thus give it an accurate evaluation, which means good projects sometimes don’t get the money,
 
whereas in the second way, people who are doing the work make the evaluation of whether it will be worth their time or not and the actual value is easy to verify afterwords, for example by paying a cohort of people to tell us all about how a particular book has been useful to them.
 
 
The notfree project helps people earn money the following way. 
 
1. calculate whether a project wil be profitable. Whether it is  or is not the best for you to help people. 
2. record your work and your life. Make your work easily available to everyone, but include a disclaimer in all of your work, saying that your work is made for the notfree project, for example using #notfree. Using the #notfree will ensure no one will be under the false belief that there is a large amount of useful information being produced for free. You can use the information, and you can get a net benefit from the information, even after having to pay little bit for it at some point, which you will have to do.
3. analyze the impact your work made. Gather evidence of the benefits of your work.
4. add the proof that you’ve done work and that it has had a beneficial impact to the notfree database
5. get paid, when we send our entire database of evidence to all the governments in the world and ask for a reasonable amount of money.
