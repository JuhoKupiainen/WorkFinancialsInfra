**The key idea

The key idea of the record-everything-now-and-let-open-source-algorithms-decide-in-a-few-years-economics.com framework, is that collecting evidence of everything that is happening, by video recording everything for example, is cheap. The technology already exists in our phone cameras and web cameras. Analyzing the recordings to determine how much should be paid to whom is expensive. But that is changing quickly. In 5 years, computation has become a lot cheaper, and intelligent algorithms have improved a lot. We will then be able to shift through all the data and pay accordingly.

**What

money = evidence of useful work

evidence of useful work = money

The purpose of the you-will-have-to-pay-a-reasonable-amount-for-this-work project, is to promote creativity in the ways with which we collect evidence of work.

The four things that are important for making money, are,

Doing useful work. this is the difficult bit, the most important bit. You have to have an understanding of what is useful and then do it.
documenting everything you do. Money is evidence. So, you’ve got to collect evidence of you doing the work. You also have to collect evidence of the consequences of your work.
making your information products easily available for everyone, if the output of your work is information. More on this in a few paragraphs.
being clear about the fact that you want to get paid for doing the work. If you’re not clear about wanting money for doing the work, people will assume you’re doing it for free, and plan their financials accordingly. Which means they won’t have any money left in their budget, when you change your mind and say you actually want to get paid.
Everyone on Earth can analyze the collected evidence years after the work was done, and then pay appropriately. This can be done through government representatives, or by other means, This is key, because computational power which is needed for doing this analysis, is getting cheaper really fast. Also, understanding the consequences of the work becomes easier after the fact.

We can write intelligent open source algorithms that will go through our data, when computation has become cheaper, and decide how much is paid to whom.

We are living a time where

recording everything is very cheap
The resources we have now are very limited, in all aspects, in comparison to what we could have in a few years. An inefficiency in how we use our resources now, will become a clear multiplicative dent in our future resources.
The future will make analyzing everything we’ve recorded cheap.
The world is full of situations where an individual has a choice between keeping an idea (like a business idea) to themselves, or telling about it to others. The net benefit is often better if the individual tells about the idea to others. Unfortunately, using old methods, it is often difficult to capitalize on this.

Have you ever not earned money from some small thing because the financial system was too cumbersome?

Have you ever not been involved in a project in which you would have been more useful than in your current project, because the people doing the project needed to keep it a secret, or because managing finances would have become trickier, even with the cost of not getting more needed people on board?

Have you ever not bought information products, or resorted to doing something illegal, because you wanted to save money?

software
books
movies
music
drugs with high R&D cost
other products with high R&D cost, such as new tech gadgets
Have you ever found it difficult to monetize your information products, such as

blogs
videos
answers on Q&A sites
books
music
software
various ideas
business ideas
inventions
ideas for improving something
Have you ever rented something to someone, and wondered how your object was treated?

Have you ever rented something from someone, and wondered if you might have gotten a better price, had the owner known that you took good care of the object.

Have you ever not taken a half empty public transportation vehicle, because you wanted to save money?

If you answered yes to any of the above, think about who benefited from the behavior you were forced upon? and why? No one really benefited much.

With the record-everything-now-and-let-open-source-algorithms-decide-in-a-few-years-economics.com platform in place, you will have a significantly increased change of avoiding these problems.

It’s possible to say things about what humans want, and then put them in a position where whether they get what they want or not depends on whether they calculate a particular well defined function. This way, the hardware running the open source algorithms can also be human brains.

Even if computers don’t become cheap enough, and we end up using humans, recording everything now and shifting through the data is still a good idea. People live on a few year loan, which is very likely to be paid back because the person will live much longer than a few years. They do their thing, and record everything. The data is shifted through in a few years. The accumulated benefits of technology development that occured from the past work that wasn’t used on shifting through data to decide how much should be given to whom right away, is larger than the interest on the few year loan.

If information that doesn’t cost anything to distribute, will benefit someone, whose benefit won’t cause you harm, you should share the information.

**In practise

How would you monetize, say, an educational video you made?

First, if there are many tasks in making the video which different people can do, you auction the work to do those tasks. That is, amongst the people who might be interested in doing one of the tasks, you agree on who does the task, and who pays who how much money, for allowing them to do the task. This provides evidence of how much other people wanted to do the task.

Second, when you make the video. You also record all the searches you make for resources you want to use in your video. This way, evidence of who else should be credited for the existance of you video is established.

Third, you add a clip at the beginning of the video, saying that people who video record themselves, twenty four seven, using the you-will-have-to-pay-for-this-work platform software, can expect to earn some money.

you-will-have-to-pay-for-this-work.com is going to select a random set of people out of all the people in the world, for example by selecting a random set of facial features, and if someone is one of the selected people, they will earn money by sending evidence of whether, or not, they have watched this particular educational video. If they’ve watched the video, they simply send the you-will-have-to-pay-for-this-work.com website a video of them watching the video. If they haven’t watched the video, they send, what they were doing while they weren’t watching the video… They will also be asked to send other evidence of the usefulness of the video, such as written descriptions of how the video affected their life. With evidence to verify the written claims. Everyone needs to send a video that was filmed before the random set of people was selected. All the video recorded by the you-will-have-to-pay-for-this-work software is timestamped using blockchain. These andom people will also be asked to submit stories about how the video changed their lives.

The random sample of people provide evidence of the usefulness of the video.

The you-will-have-to-pay-for-this-work software platform will give people an easy way to record everything they do. While they’re going about their lives, the software will collect evidence that is useful in determining the usefulness of various information products. People can send evidence, that they approve, to the you-will-have-to-pay-for-this-work.com website, and get money in return.

**Why

Things that are about producing new useful information, are things like making movies, developing new medications and answering questions on question and answer sites. All of these things take hard work. The output of this work, is information that is highly valuable to a lot of people.

If you set a fixed price for a given block of information, for example you give a fixed price for an E-book, then there are always some people who don’t buy it because it’s too expensive. Isn’t that how it’s supposed to be? If you don’t want to pay the full price, then you shouldn’t get the product. Well, if you were selling rice, or oil, that would make sense, but with information, it doesn’t make sense because the information already exists and you can copy information as much as you want, that doesn’t cost anything. Reducing the price gains more customers, but since the price is lower for everyone, including the already existing customers, it’s not profitable to do so.

One could give a price that depends on the person, if someone seems like they really want the E-book for example, we give them a higher price, and make a legal contract prohibiting them from redistributing the book. The problem with this is that it’s difficult to guess how much someone would be willing to pay. What if someone wants to browse through a book. A split second decision needs to be made, about how useful this browsing experience is. And what if someone writes a book that has the same content, but written in different words, and sells their book for a much lower price?

The best way, the only way really, is to collect taxes from people and vote for how these taxes are spent on information producing projects. There are two ways to do this.

The first way is to pay pay people as they are doing the work, based on how useful we think the outcome of the work will be.

The second way is to pay people after they’ve done the work and we can analyze how useful the work was.

In the first way people get the money right away, whereas in the second way people have to get a loan and wait for the money.

In the first way it can be often difficult for outsiders to understand what the outcome of some work will be, before it’s ready, and thus cannot give accurate evaluation. This means good projects sometimes don’t get the money,

Whereas in the second way, people who are doing the work make the evaluation of whether it will be worth their time or not and the actual value is easy to verify afterwords.

Your life is worth recording!

Your work is worth money!
